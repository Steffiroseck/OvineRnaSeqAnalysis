# OvineRnaSeqAnalysis

## Introduction
The script would take set of paired end fastq reads for RNA-Seq analysis. The outputs are directed to specific folders for each of the steps. The important steps are:
1. Quality check
2. Adapter trimming
3. Read Alignment to reference genome
4. Generating read count matrix
5. Differential expression analysis
6. Functional enrichment analysis and visualization
